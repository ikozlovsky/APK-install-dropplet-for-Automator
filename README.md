To download you may use git:
> $ git clone https://github.com/ikozlovsky/APK-install-dropplet-for-Automator.git

 or download a repo as zip

To install - double click on a .workflow and select a folder. To work, adb needs to be installed in /usr/local/bin/ - via brew or symlinked to the one in an Android SDK folder.

Once everything's prepared, put .APKs in a dropplet and wait for the target dialog (wifi/emulator/usb).
